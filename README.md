# Scrybble sync - Think analog, organize digital

Scrybble sync lets you access your handwritten notes from a [reMarkable tablet](https://remarkable.com) - a digital paper tablet for distraction-free writing and reading.

## Searchable highlights and written text

All typed text on your device, along with all the passages you highlight while reading and researching are conveniently gathered in a single Markdown file per Document.

All of these are neatly organized per page.

Perfect for people with a [Type Folio](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro/type-folio)

## Quick access to all of your ebooks, PDFs, Quick Notes and worksheets in your vault

The reMarkable is an amazing device, but it can be frustrating or worrisome that all your notes, documents, papers and eBooks are in only one place.

You can safely store them in your vault.

## Staying organized with tags

The tags you add on the reMarkable will show up in the generated Markdown documents, so it's easy to stay organized.

- Any tags added to the document itself will appear in the frontmatter
- Tags you add to specific pages will show up along the page headings
